# imgd

`imgd` (read *imaged*) is an image-resizer (and more) written using the Python PIL library. If you have tons of images you would like to resize adaptively to a screen-size using a single command, `imgd` is the utility for you. In most cases, `imgd` will save on storage while converting to smaller resolutions. There are additional optimization options too.

`imgd` intends to be a stronger replacement for the resizer in Nautilus Image Converter extension, not tied to any File Manager and much faster. The Nautilus Image Converter is essentially a GTK extension with a library of its own that calls the `convert` utility of the ImageMagick library. On Desktop Environments (like Xfce or LxQt) which do not integrate Nautilus, `imgd` will save your day.

`imgd` works with Python 3.5 and above.

Nascent and under active development. Consider alpha.
